Introduction
============

TinyFSM is a simple and fast finite state machine library for
C++. It allows flexible modelling of state machines:

- Entry/exit actions
- Event actions
- Transition functions
- Transition conditions
- Events with payload
- Inheritance of action functions

Its simplicity and speed makes TinyFSM ideal for real-time operating
systems. In the best case, dispatching an event has a performance
footprint equal to calling (or inlining) a function. In the worst case,
dispatching leads to a single vtable lookup and function call.

TinyFSM benefits from the C++11 template metaprogramming features like
variadic templates, and does not depend on RTTI, exceptions or any
external library.
